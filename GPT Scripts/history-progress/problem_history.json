    "problem" : "## Title: Custom Calendar View\n\n### Problem Statement:\n\nYou are tasked with creating a custom calendar view for an iOS application. The view should display a full month with dates and allow users to select a range of dates. \n\nYou should write a function that will generate the calendar view and enable the user to select a date range. The selected date range should be highlighted with a different color to provide a visual difference. The calendar should also handle situations where the date range spans across multiple months.\n\nYour function should be able to handle the following scenarios:\n\n- The user selects a start date and an end date that are both in the same month.\n- The user selects a start date in one month, and an end date in the following month.\n- The user selects a start date in one month, and an end date in a month that is not immediately following the start date.\n\nFunction Signature: `func createCalendarView(startDate: Date, endDate: Date) -> UIView`\n\n### Constraints:\n\n- The function takes two parameters: `startDate` and `endDate`. Both are instances of `Date` and `startDate` is always less than or equal to `endDate`.\n- The function should return a `UIView` that represents the calendar.\n- The calendar should be a grid with 7 columns (for the 7 days of the week) and enough rows to accommodate the dates in the given range.\n- The calendar should display the full month for the start and end dates.\n- If the selected date range spans across multiple months, the calendar should display all the months within the range, each as a separate month grid.\n- The dates that fall within the selected range should be highlighted with a different color.\n\n### Examples:\n\n#### Example 1:\n\nIf `startDate` is \"2022-01-01\" and `endDate` is \"2022-01-15\", the function should return a calendar view for January 2022 with dates 1 to 15 highlighted.\n\n#### Example 2:\n\nIf `startDate` is \"2022-01-28\" and `endDate` is \"2022-02-05\", the function should return a calendar view for January and February 2022 with dates 28, 29, 30, 31 of January and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of February highlighted.\n\n#### Example 3:\n\nIf `startDate` is \"2022-01-15\" and `endDate` is \"2022-03-15\", the function should return a calendar view for January, February, and March 2022 with dates 15 to 31 of January, all dates of February, and 1 to 15 of March highlighted.\n\n### Optimal Time and Space Complexity:\n\nThe time complexity should be O(1) as the number of days in a month is fixed (28 to 31 days). The space complexity should also be O(1) as the size of the UIView does not change with the input size.",
